&lt;p&gt;After a wee interval over the summer months, the 6th PyData Dublin meetup took place on Thursday evening, 30th August 2018. The end of the summer event was hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://careers.google.com/locations/dublin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; on their wonderful Ocean’s Eleven floor at their Grand Mill Quay offices, Dublin. along with a variety of refreshments (including pizza and beer) specially for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every year millions of people around the world run marathons. As race-day approaches, and training schedules begin to wind down, many participants will turn their attention to their race strategy. In this talk we will describe a machine learning approach to supporting runners in this process by helping them to select a suitable target finish-time and a race-plan to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better time to have a talk on using data for personal best prediction than with the Dublin Marathon just around the corner. During his talk, Barry describes how he first collected data from a large number of marathon websites using &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrapy.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scrapy&lt;/a&gt;, a Python scraping and web crawling framework. Then, using case based reasoning in combination with machine learning approaches (such as kNN, linear regression, random forests, and elastic nets), they were able to derive accurate predictions of personal best times across all levels of ability with less than 5% prediction error. Overall, the talk highlighted the huge potential that A.I. tools and techniques developed in other domains, such as recommender systems, have in the future of personalized and adaptive lifestyle assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every programming language has its caveats, traps, tricks, and nonsenses - its wats. While simple and consistent, Python is not out of the game, albeit most of its edge behaviors are not apparent, as they are caused by underlying code optimization. In this talk, I’m going to show some of the most common Python gotchas, referring to the CPython implementation version 3.5, showing how they can lead unaware or inexperienced programmers to catastrophic and unexpected results. There will be space, of course, for simple Easter eggs left around by humorous contributors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Derek Greene presented the second talk of the evening, where he walked through how easy it can be to efficiently perform text processing, representation, and topic modelling using Python’s scikit-learn package. In fact, he has provided all materials used for the talk as notebooks which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/derekgreene/topic-model-tutorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, although the talk focused on applying topic modelling to documents, Derek noted that topic modelling has also been applied to non-textual datasets to. A recent example being Nathanael Aff’s: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nateaff.com/2017/09/11/lego-topic-models/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEGO color themes as topic models&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Derek touched on the practical issues associated with topic modelling, emphasizing how it’s best used as an exploratory tool to aid human interpretation and how domain knowledge is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Python is a versatile language and it supports a wide variety of programming paradigms. At its heart it’s object-oriented, but in this talk I want to discuss how you can use Python to write clean, efficient, and modular functional code. I’ll begin by giving a little background on what functional programming is and why you might use it. I’ll talk through some of the simple primitives of functional programming, and I’ll give some useful examples of functional code for data analysis. The aim is to give a practical and pragmatic introduction to these ideas, covering some of the strengths and weaknesses of Python as a functional language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 minute lightning talks, from describing a library you’ve found useful, to things you wish you’d known when you first started, or even the top 5 packages that you couldn’t live without.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15-20 minute talk with questions. Perhaps you’ve recently written a blog, project, or paper that relates to data analysis, management, processing, or visualization. Let us know and we can help you share it with the larger PyData community.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Saturday, PyData Dublin will be heading to the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham for 404, an event which describes itself as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Ultimate Tech Meetup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an all day affair with a variety of speakers and installations from different tech communities. The agenda itself can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404.ie/agenda#main-stage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I’m really looking forward to just being at the same venue as 40+ different Dublin tech meetup organizers! I’m also excited to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404.ie/speakers/?speaker=katharine-jarmul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katharine Jarmul&lt;/a&gt;, the person who first got me interested in PyData in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it looks set to be a fun and simulating day out for tech enthusiasts of all levels. It has even been featured as a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rte.ie/eile/tech/2017/0926/907711-404-uncovered-how-we-built-dublins-newest-tech-event/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RTE’s Tech News&lt;/a&gt;!

  &lt;p&gt;Topic models aim to automatically discover the underlying thematic structure in a collection of documents. Popular approaches include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF). In this talk I will describe how to use the Python scikit-learn package to preprocess a document collection, to apply both LDA and NMF to generate topic models, and then to explore the resulting models to get a better understanding of the contents of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
